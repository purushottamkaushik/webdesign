    At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give
    them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a
    document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed
    content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce
    fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.

    <pre>

   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages â€” for example, to alter the font,
            color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and
            other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery
            with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add
            styling to HTML.
